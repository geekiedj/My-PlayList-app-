# My-PlayList-app-

With this simple application, you can store your favorite songs and playlists locally. 
This project was an experiment for me because I wanted to test my OOP skills. 
It was also easier to understand things after watching Traversy's video on OOP.
I learned about using static to instantiate a class and stringify which converts a value to JSON.
